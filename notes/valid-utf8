UTF8 high bits can start with:
- anything if number <= 0x7F (ascii)
- 0xC: 0b1100 XXXX
- 0xD: 0b1100 XXXX
- 0xE: 0b1110 XXXX
- 0xF: 0b1111 XXXX

Meanwhile zoab starts with: JTLL LLLL

> originally this was TJ... but they were swapped, the reasons are below!

There are only two invalid zoab bytes: J=0 T=0|1 and L=0

Therefore we can craft an invalid byte for _both_ zoab and utf8: J=1 T=0 L=0,
or 0b1000 0000, i.e. 0x80.
